I am NOT the owner of the name SonnenBatterie. 
This name could be property of sonnen GmbH. 
But since this is only a compound noun 
and I want to write a prediction AI for the monitoring data,
I consider the use in the name as FairUse. If I am wrong,
I will rename this GitHub repo as soon as possible.
Please make a GitHub Issue for that, with a sort prove of that.
